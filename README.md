# Updatable Hello World

## [Contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x1BD8276D09f88063cFCd007aD13aC3958E0eb41D)

This project comes as a solution to Patrick McCorry's Cryptocurrency Class 2022 challenge 1. 

It's a simple contract that allows you to do three thrings:
 - Get the latest message;
 - Update the latest message;
 - Retrieve a specific user message, by passing the `user address` and `message index` as an argument.


To build this project, `hardhat` and `create-react-app` were used - and the commands available are the default commands for each package. See their website for instructions if needed.

Finally, you can fork this repository and modify the contract or frontend easily. Just don't forget to modify the config files and add any information that is needed.
